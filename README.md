# Project Purpose

This project is designed as an exploration and integration of several cutting-edge technologies, focusing on building a comprehensive application that seamlessly connects a command-line interface (CLI) with a backend and a web frontend. The primary objectives are:

## Technology Integration
To develop a cohesive system that combines a CLI for user interaction, a robust backend for data processing, and a dynamic web interface for user-friendly access.

## Containerization with Docker
To gain hands-on experience with Docker by containerizing the entire application stack, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment across various environments.

## Cloud Deployment with AWS
To explore cloud computing by deploying the application on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2, S3, and RDS, thereby understanding the intricacies of cloud architecture and management.

## Comprehensive Documentation
To emphasize the importance of documentation, this project will include detailed guides and manuals to document the development process, deployment instructions, and user manuals, enhancing the application's usability and maintainability.
